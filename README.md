# CountersPlus
A combination of widely-used counters, all configurable in one mod.

## What is this?
**Counters+** (also known as CountersPlus) is a mod that bundles different counters, both widely used and quite unusual, into one mod. Counters+ also boasts a large amount of configuration, all available from a custom made settings menu that updates in real time!

## Available Counters
|Counter|Version Added|Description|
|-|-|-|
|***Progress***|`1.0.0`|Overwrites the in-game counter with the original we all know and love!|
|***Score***|`1.0.0`|Also overwrites with the original Score counter!|
|***Missed***|`1.0.0`|Counts missed notes in a song.|
|***Notes***|`1.0.0`|Notes hit over notes in total. Now in percentages!|
|***Speed***|`1.1.0`|*"Speed, motherfucker, do you speak it?"* Displays how fast your arms are swinging!|
|***Cut***|`1.1.0`|Displays the average cut score (Anywhere from 0-110), so you can see how well you are hitting those notes!|
|***Spinometer***|`1.4.1`|Displays angular velocity of your sabers. Can you beat 3600 degress per second?|
|***Personal Best***|`1.5.5`|Displays your high score in a map, and changes color depending on how close you are to beating it!|
|***Notes Left***|`1.5.8`|Notes Left counter has now been merged into Counters+. It's pretty self explanatory.|
|***Fail***|`1.5.8`|Display how many times you've failed across every song, or how many times you've restarted the same song!|

### Custom Counters
Counters+ also supports the addition of Custom Counters. Other mods can input their counters into the Counters+ system and allow the user to edit the position through the Counters+ UI.
